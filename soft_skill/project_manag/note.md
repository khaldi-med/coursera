###fundamental project management:

####1.1 What is Project

* It clarifies the definitions of three key terms: project, project manager, and project management. 
    * A project is a temporary undertaking with a specific goal, interrelated tasks, and a finite duration. It is unique and operates under certain constraints. In contrast, ongoing work processes are repetitive tasks that occur regularly in an organization. 
    * Project management involves the tools and processes used to plan, execute, and complete projects. The four main constraints in project management are scope, quality, cost, and time. These constraints determine the size, quality, cost, and duration of a project. Additionally, the Project Management Institute includes two additional constraints: risk and resources. If any of these constraints change during a project, adjustments must be made to maintain balance.
