### Fundamental project management

####1.1 What is Project

* It clarifies the definitions of three key terms: project, project manager, and project management. 
    * A project is a temporary undertaking with a specific goal, interrelated tasks, and a finite duration. It is unique and operates under certain constraints. In contrast, ongoing work processes are repetitive tasks that occur regularly in an organization. 
    * Project management involves the tools and processes used to plan, execute, and complete projects. The four main constraints in project management are scope, quality, cost, and time. These constraints determine the size, quality, cost, and duration of a project. Additionally, the Project Management Institute includes two additional constraints: risk and resources. If any of these constraints change during a project, adjustments must be made to maintain balance.

####1.2 Scope and project management:

* I. Scope:

A. Three ways to talk about scope:
    1. Product scope

        3. Determine appropriate communication method (direct meetings vs. reports)

### WBS 
    - A **work-breakdown structure (WBS)** in project management and systems engineering is a deliverable-oriented breakdown of a project into smaller components. 
A work breakdown structure is a key project management element that organizes the team's work into manageable sections. 
The Project Management Body of Knowledge defines the work-breakdown structure as a "hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to be carried out by the project team to accomplish the project objectives and create the required deliverables.

A WBS provides the necessary framework for detailed cost estimation and control while providing guidance for schedule development and control.

#### 2.1 Planning

* I. Introduction to Risk Management
    - Part of the planning process group
    - Focuses on identifying and addressing potential project issues

* II. Definition of Risk
    - Uncertain events that may or may not happen
    - Can be positive or negative (focus on negative risks)

* III. Four Steps of Risk Management
    - Identify risks
    - Analyze risks
    - Develop risk management plans
    - Implement plans when necessary

* IV. Risk Analysis Components
    - Impact: How severe the consequences would be
    - Probability: How likely the risk is to occur
    - Triggers: Signs that indicate a risk is imminent or has occurred

* V. Risk Response Strategies
    - Mitigation: Reduce the impact or probability
    - Transfer: Shift the risk to another party
    - Avoidance: Change the project to eliminate the risk
    - Acceptance: Prepare for the risk but take no preemptive action

* VI. Risk Assessment Tool
    - Risk matrix with impact and probability scored 1-5
    - Total risk score = Impact x Probability (max 25)
    - Determine acceptable risk levels for the organization
    - Develop strategies to reduce high-risk scores
    - Include a separate list of triggers for each risk

* Demonstrates how context affects probability
* Illustrates different risk response strategies based on ability to predict (triggers)

#### Planing and the WBS

* What is WBS?
    - Definition: A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a deliverable-oriented grouping of project elements, providing a framework for organizing and defining the total scope of a project.
    * Levels of Detail: Each ascending level of the WBS represents an increasingly detailed definition of project work.

* Purpose of WBS
    - Foundation for Planning: WBS is essential for:
    - Defining tasks and deliverables.
    - Estimating costs and resources.
    - Facilitating communication within the project team.
    - Task Organization: It breaks down the project into manageable sections, from high-level deliverables to detailed tasks.

* Schools of Thought on WBS
    - High-Level Only: Some advocate for a WBS that includes only deliverables and work packages, with detailed tasks listed in a separate WBS dictionary or task list.
    - Detailed Inclusion: Others believe all detailed tasks should be included in the WBS, creating a comprehensive structure.

* Key Components of WBS
    - Deliverables: Unique, verifiable products or results.
    - Project Activities: Components of work necessary to produce deliverables.
    - Work Packages: Groupings of related tasks that can be assigned and managed.

* Building the WBS
    - Define Deliverables: Identify what needs to be accomplished based on the projectâ€™s goals.
    - Identify Tasks: Break down the deliverables into specific tasks necessary for completion.

* Scope Representation
    * Product Scope: All deliverables associated with the project.
    * Project Scope: The total work required to deliver the project.

* Levels of WBS
    * Program Level: Encompasses multiple related projects, forming a larger entity (usually relevant for program managers).
    * Project Level: The focus for most project managers, detailing the specific project being managed.

* The WBS is a foundational tool in project management that helps in planning, organizing, and controlling project scope. By breaking down tasks into manageable components, project managers can better allocate resources, estimate costs, and track progress throughout the project lifecycle.

### Planing and scheduling

* Risks and Float Time Impact
    - Risk Management: If delays occur (e.g., a blown tire), they will affect the critical path. The goal is to have float time to absorb such risks.
    - Total Float vs. Free Float:
    - Total Float: The overall slack across the project.
    - Free Float: Remaining slack for a specific task after accounting for delays in preceding tasks.

* Steps to Build a Schedule
    - Extract Detailed Tasks from WBS:
        * Begin with the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) to identify all detailed tasks necessary for the project.
    - Add Task Durations:
    - Assign specific durations to each task based on estimates of how long each will take.
    - Arrange Tasks:
        * Organize tasks into sequences and identify any simultaneous relationships that may exist.
    - Set Project Start or Completion:
        * Decide whether to schedule from the project start date or work backwards from the completion date.
    - Determine Early and Late Start/Finish:
    - Calculate early start, late start, early finish, and late finish for each task to understand scheduling flexibility.
* Creating a Network Diagram
    - Activity on Node Format:
        * Use a network diagram to visualize tasks, durations, and relationships without headers for clarity.
    - Tasks:
        * Create boxes representing each task, including durations and scheduling details.
    - Milestones:
        A milestone is a task with zero duration that signifies a significant point in the project (e.g., getting into the car).
    - Identifying the Critical Path
        * Critical Path:
            * Tasks on the critical path have no float time; any delay in these tasks will delay the overall project.
    - Float Time:
        * Total float represents the amount of time that a series of tasks can be delayed without affecting the project deadline.
    - Gantt Chart Representation
        * Transition to Gantt Chart:
    - Convert the network diagram into a Gantt chart for a visual timeline representation of tasks and critical paths.
    - Features:
        * Gantt charts show task durations, dependencies, milestones, and float time visually.
    - Scheduling Software
        * Common Tools:
            - Microsoft Project is the most widely used software, but there are many alternatives available.
        * Managing Constraints
            * Human Resource Availability:
        * Adjust schedules based on the availability of team members, which may affect the critical path.
        * Adjusting the Schedule
        * Crashing:
            - Shorten task durations to meet deadlines, which may increase costs.
        * Fast-Tracking:
            - Perform tasks simultaneously that were initially planned in sequence, which may increase project risk.
        * Scope Reduction:
            - Reduce project scope or quality as a last resort to fit within the timeline.
    * A project schedule involves a systematic approach to organizing tasks, estimating durations, and visualizing dependencies. By understanding critical paths and managing resources effectively, project managers can ensure timely project completion while being prepared to adjust as necessary.
