###fundamental project management:

####1.1 What is Project

* It clarifies the definitions of three key terms: project, project manager, and project management. 
    * A project is a temporary undertaking with a specific goal, interrelated tasks, and a finite duration. It is unique and operates under certain constraints. In contrast, ongoing work processes are repetitive tasks that occur regularly in an organization. 
    * Project management involves the tools and processes used to plan, execute, and complete projects. The four main constraints in project management are scope, quality, cost, and time. These constraints determine the size, quality, cost, and duration of a project. Additionally, the Project Management Institute includes two additional constraints: risk and resources. If any of these constraints change during a project, adjustments must be made to maintain balance.

####1.2 Scope and project management:

* I. Scope:

A. Three ways to talk about scope:
    1. Product scope
    2. Project scope
    3. Total scope

B. Product scope
    - What the final product looks like
    - All things created and provided by the project

C. Project scope
    - All work required to create the product

D. Total scope
    - Combination of product scope and project scope
    - Includes all work and resources needed

    II. Project Definition
A. PMI definition: "A temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service or result"

    III. Project Manager Skills
A. Technical knowledge
    - Not a subject matter expert on everything
    - Enough knowledge to understand project language and processes

B. Leadership skills
    - Ability to work with people
    - Lead the project team

 C. Various roles
    1. Task and human management
    2. Integrator vs. technical expert
    3. Big picture and detail focus
    4. Politics and stakeholder management
    5. Balancing projects vs. organizational functions

    IV. Project Management
A. Definition: Application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities

B. PMI Process Groups
   1. Initiating
   2. Planning
   3. Executing
   4. Monitoring and Controlling
   5. Closing

C. PMI Knowledge Areas
   1. Integration
   2. Scope
   3. Time
   4. Cost
   5. Quality
   6. Human Resources
   7. Communication
   8. Risk
   9. Procurement
   10. Stakeholder Management

####1.3 Planning and Scheduling

- I. Initiating Process Group
    * A. Purpose: Starting and defining the project

- II. Key Elements of Initiating
    * A. Stakeholder Identification
        1. People involved in, affected by, or interested in the project
        2. Includes project team, manager, sponsor, and customers
        3. Customers: subset of stakeholders who receive project deliverables.
    * B. Project Charter
        1. Minimum requirements:
            - Project name (formal sanction)
            - Project manager's name (authority to use resources)
        2. Additional content:
            - High-level summary of project plan
            - Agreement between involved parties
            - Definition of the project
            - Guide for project activities
- III. Scope Statement
    * A. Often combined with Project Charter in practice
    * B. Defines project size and deliverables

- IV. Example Project: Expanding University Sports Stadium
    * A. Potential stakeholders:
        - Students, Faculty, University President
        - Athletic Department
        - Homeowners around the stadium
        - City departments
    * B. Deliverables:
        1. New turf
        2. New lighting
        3. New seating
        4. New parking lot
        5. New scoreboard
####1.4 Stakeholder Analysis
 - A. Purpose: Systematically gather and analyze information about stakeholders
 - B. Importance: Helps project managers anticipate and address stakeholder concerns

* II. Stakeholder Analysis Matrix
    - A. Tool to visualize stakeholder power and interest
    - B. Four quadrants: High/Low Power, High/Low Interest
    - C. Helps determine how to engage with different stakeholders

* III. Example: Homeowners near stadium
    - A. Why they're stakeholders: Affected by traffic, noise, etc.
    - B. Power/Interest: High interest, potentially high power as a group
    - C. Engagement strategies:
        1. Involve them and get their input
        2. Address their concerns
        3. Provide regular status reports
        4. Possible incentives (e.g., parking revenue, complimentary tickets)

* IV. Example: University President
    - A. Why they're a stakeholder: Oversight, university reputation, etc.
    - B. Power/Interest: High power, high interest
    - C. Engagement strategies:
        1. Provide constant information
        2. Regular status reports (e.g., weekly)
        3. Determine appropriate communication method (direct meetings vs. reports)

###WBS 
    - A **work-breakdown structure (WBS)** in project management and systems engineering is a deliverable-oriented breakdown of a project into smaller components. 
A work breakdown structure is a key project management element that organizes the team's work into manageable sections. 
The Project Management Body of Knowledge defines the work-breakdown structure as a "hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to be carried out by the project team to accomplish the project objectives and create the required deliverables.

A WBS provides the necessary framework for detailed cost estimation and control while providing guidance for schedule development and control.

####2.1 Planning

I. Introduction to Risk Management
A. Part of the planning process group
B. Focuses on identifying and addressing potential project issues

II. Definition of Risk
A. Uncertain events that may or may not happen
B. Can be positive or negative (focus on negative risks)

III. Four Steps of Risk Management
A. Identify risks
B. Analyze risks
C. Develop risk management plans
D. Implement plans when necessary

IV. Risk Analysis Components

B. Probability: How likely the risk is to occur
C. Triggers: Signs that indicate a risk is imminent or has occurred

V. Risk Response Strategies
A. Mitigation: Reduce the impact or probability
B. Transfer: Shift the risk to another party
C. Avoidance: Change the project to eliminate the risk
D. Acceptance: Prepare for the risk but take no preemptive action

VI. Risk Assessment Tool
