# Creative Thinking: Techniques and Tools for Success

* Usually, people link the term creativity only with transformational or major breakthrough ideas. However, according to creativity experts, creativity is often thought to exist on at least two levels; a lower and a higher level, with each level representing a different type of creative problem solving.

* Lower level creativity is often referred to as **small "c"** creativity, whereas the higher level is referred to as big **"C" creativity.**

These levels account for modest, everyday changes, through to grand paradigm-shifts.

* Creativity can also be categorized as **P&H** which refers to **Psychological creativity or Historical creativity.** These levels account for an idea that has occurred to an individual for the first time, versus the first time an idea has ever occurred in the history of the human race.

* **Small "c" creativity** describes the small ideas that add to our everyday lives. This can include cooking dinner or rearranging your cupboards, enhanced in some manner. They are not things that will make you rich or famous, but they are every day, small accomplishments, which enrich and enhance our lives. 

* Therefore, creativity is not just found in an engaging picture hanging on the wall, it can be found in actions and objects. When you woke up this morning to get ready for your day, you used many objects that embody creativity, which in turn made your day a little easier.

* **Big "C" creativity** goes beyond the everyday problem solving, where humankind has made giant leaps in, for example, literature and academia where evidence of grand creativity can be found. These milestones can be embodied or represented by objects, be it the spaceship that took the first person to the moon, or a painting that provoked a new movement of thoughts and techniques.

### Top 6 Brainstorming Techniques
    
    * Let's start with Brainstorming. The aim of this tool is not to produce inventions for fully developed products, instead, it is used to assist with the generation of ideas. This can be done at any stage of the problem-solving process but tends to focus on problem exploration, idea generation, and concept evaluation.

* Brainstorming is a well-known activity which involves a multi-disciplinary group of people to solve the stated problem. Yet the rules and types of brainstorming may not be as familiar. Learning and applying the rules and types of brainstorming can make the sessions dramatically more productive.

* The various types of brainstorming which you will be learning about during this week, include:
    
    * **1. Flipchart:**
        - The Flip Chart approach serves as a great entry activity to a brainstorming session. For example, it can be used to determine the important areas of a problem. The group can "Flip Chart" brainstorm these for several minutes.     
        
        1. During preparation, ensure that the brief defines the problems and that people, pens and drawing surface are available
        
        2. Organize the group so that all can see the display medium

        3. Remind participants of the brief

        4. Invite solutions for a period of time (no criticism allowed)

        5. Record ideas

        6. End the session when the frequency of ideas has reduced and energy levels of the group have dropped

        7. Review or reinvigorate for another session

        8. Re-review the material to see if additional ideas are inspired by (for instance, a combination of two of the suggestions).

    * 2. Post-its:
        - They are a great size to focus and record a single idea. As Post-its can be peeled off a surface and re-applied several times, the ideas can then be rearranged and ordered into groups of similar ideas. The approach encourages a group to come together and generate ideas simultaneously. 
        
        1. Define the brief

        2. Distribute the brief to the participants in advance of the session

        3. Remind the participants of the brief

        4. Allow participants to record ideas for 10-20 min

        5. Review the ideas generated individually or inspire additional ideas 

        6. Allow for a further idea-generation session to take place 

        7. Review the ideas generated collectively by asking participants to share their favorite ideas 

        8. Invite the group to categorize the ideas by rearranging the postits 

    * 3. Brainwriting: 
        - Brainwriting is a series of techniques developed by Horst Geschka at the Batelle Institute in Frankfurt (Geschka, 1993). Most of the session is done in silence as it encourages a group of participants to develop ideas in parallel.
        1. Define and introduce the brief

        2. Arrange the group in a circle

        3. Distribute blank cards to each participant

        4. Ask participants to sketch an idea on a card

        5. Allow participants to silently, pass the card to the next group member in one direction

        6. Ask participants to read the card received and see if it inspires an idea several idea cards will be being passed around the group

        7. Collect all cards after 10-20 min

        8. Review the ideas generated collectively by asking participants to share their favourite ideas

	* 4. Alphabet:
        - As the name suggests, in an Alphabet brainstorming session, participants are invited to work through the alphabet letter by letter. With one set parameter, the letter itself, it inspires a wide range of ideas. It also encourages the creative use of the letter to form a sentence or phrase, rather than an idea that is one or two words. 
        
        1. Define the brief

        2. Distribute the brief to the participants in advance of the session

        3. Remind the participants of the brief Record suggested ideas start with the letter A

        4. Continue with each letter of the alphabet sequentially

        5. Review the ideas generated collectively by asking participants to comment on their favourite ideas.
 
	* 5. Grid:
        - During Grid brainstorming, a 3 by 3 grid is recommended. The number of columns dictates the number of ideas needed to initiate the process. The number of rows dictates how many times the idea is passed on and developed. By the end of a session, many ideas have been generated and developed by using the inspiration of previously generated ideas.

        1. Provide group members with a grid 

        2. Define and introduce the brief to the group

        3. Ask participants to sketch and complete the top row

        4. When finished, ask participants to place the sheets in the middle for someone else to work on the next row developing the ideas further.
        5. Once the grid is complete, review ideas as a group

        > For an effective grid brainstorming session, participants should be patient and allow each person to complete the row of ideas before passing on the page. 

    * 6. Circle brainstorming.


### Thinking styles
    
* **Diversity:** is an essential ingredient to creativity. When we experience a new culture we learn new ways of approaching and doing things, diversifying our thinking. So if we are looking to generate more creative ideas to a problem, one way we can achieve this is to diversify our thinking.

* divergent thinking, convergent thinking, design thinking, systems thinking, analytical thinking, critical thinking, analogical reasoning, inductive reasoning, and deductive reasoning.

* creative thinking, including brainstorming, leveraging personal knowledge and experience, moving into new territory, experimenting, exploring connections and relationships, combining opposites, and regularly re-examining and revising ideas.

* Design thinking is a mindset and approach used in business and education.

* It involves exploring new concepts and directions for business and enterprise.

* Design thinking helps generate solutions that address the needs of users and stakeholders.

* It includes processes such as discovery, envisioning, experimentation, and integration.

* Design thinking can be applied to physical products, services, and non-physical entities like organizations.

* It involves activities like tolerating ambiguity, seeing the big picture, making decisions, teamwork, and communication.

* The approach includes phases of iteration, ideation, prototyping, testing, problem-solving, and implementation.

* Design thinking is a valuable tool for stimulating innovation and driving organizational change.
