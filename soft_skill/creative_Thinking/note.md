# Creative Thinking: Techniques and Tools for Success

* Usually, people link the term creativity only with transformational or major breakthrough ideas. However, according to creativity experts, creativity is often thought to exist on at least two levels; a lower and a higher level, with each level representing a different type of creative problem solving.

* Lower level creativity is often referred to as **small "c"** creativity, whereas the higher level is referred to as big **"C" creativity.**

These levels account for modest, everyday changes, through to grand paradigm-shifts.

Creativity can also be categorized as P&H which refers to Psychological creativity or Historical creativity. These levels account for an idea that has occurred to an individual for the first time, versus the first time an idea has ever occurred in the history of the human race.

* **Small "c" creativity** describes the small ideas that add to our everyday lives. This can include cooking dinner or rearranging your cupboards, enhanced in some manner. They are not things that will make you rich or famous, but they are every day, small accomplishments, which enrich and enhance our lives. 

* Therefore, creativity is not just found in an engaging picture hanging on the wall, it can be found in actions and objects. When you woke up this morning to get ready for your day, you used many objects that embody creativity, which in turn made your day a little easier.

* **Big "C" creativity** goes beyond the everyday problem solving, where humankind has made giant leaps in, for example, literature and academia where evidence of grand creativity can be found. These milestones can be embodied or represented by objects, be it the spaceship that took the first person to the moon, or a painting that provoked a new movement of thoughts and techniques.
